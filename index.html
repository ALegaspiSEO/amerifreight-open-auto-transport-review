      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-6 animate-fade-in">What is Open Auto Transport?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Open auto transport is the most widely used method for shipping vehicles in the United States. It involves loading your vehicle onto an open-air carrier, similar to those seen on highways, where it is securely strapped in for transit. Unlike enclosed transport, which shields vehicles from all external elements, open transport exposes cars to weather conditions like rain, sun, or dust. However, it remains a safe, efficient, and cost-effective option for most vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, trucks, and motorcycles.</p>
      <img src="/open-carrier.png" alt="Open car carrier transporting vehicles on a highway" class="w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6 hover-scale">
      <p class="mb-4">AmeriFreight ensures that their open carriers are operated by experienced, insured professionals, providing peace of mind for customers. Open transport is ideal for everyday vehicles that don’t require the premium protection of enclosed trailers. It’s perfect for short or long-distance moves, offering a balance of affordability and reliability.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Key advantages of open auto transport include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Budget-Friendly:</strong> Open transport costs 40-60% less than enclosed transport, making it accessible for most vehicle owners.</li>
        <li><strong>High Availability:</strong> With more open carriers on the road, scheduling is faster and more flexible.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatile Vehicle Support:</strong> Accommodates a wide range of vehicles, from compact cars to larger trucks and SUVs.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Handling:</strong> Vehicles are securely fastened to prevent movement, ensuring safe delivery even in varying weather conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">While open transport may not suit high-value or delicate vehicles like classic cars, it’s an excellent choice for standard vehicles. AmeriFreight’s expertise ensures that your car is handled with care, making open transport a reliable option for most shipping needs.</p>
